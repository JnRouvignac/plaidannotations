Here is the project where we keep annotations used by the PLAID group's static analyses, developed at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu).

Currently, annotation classes used by the [Plural](http://code.google.com/p/pluralism) object protocol checker are available.
[Here](http://plaidannotations.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/PlaidAnnotations/doc/index.html) is their [documentation](http://plaidannotations.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/PlaidAnnotations/doc/index.html).

The [FUSION](http://code.google.com/p/fusion) (Framework Usage SpecificatIONs) project also uses these annotations. You can find documentation for how to use FUSION annotations on [the FUSION wiki](http://code.google.com/p/fusion/w/list).
